          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, in the compagny 
          i joined. I honestly feel i got every penny's worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people 
          who had an amezing experience here. I signed up for for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, 
          working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

          "Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure 
          from professionnals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll 
          by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderfull things about the program. The entire curriculum 
          and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile 
          team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
          could ever have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developement experience 
          It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting gudance from them and learning 
          from their experiences was easy.

          "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progess which i find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence 
          necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior develper. The standard is above the rest.
          You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. "
